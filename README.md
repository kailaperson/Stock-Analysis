# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project 
- The purpose of this analysis was to refactor an already made code to run faster and more efficently for many more stocks.

## Results
 - For the given dataset, the stocks did better in 2017 rather than 2018. In 2018 the total daily volume decreased, so the return decreased. 

 - Using the refactored code on the data set returned the results in under a second. Using the orginal code was bringing the results back in more than a second.

 - Please the attached images to support my results.

## Summary 
- The advantages of refactoring  code is that it returns the data back faster. Another advantage is that you can use it for larger data sets. The disadvantges of refactoring code is  debugging and make suring the data prodcued the same results. 

- The pros and cons applied to refactorting the orginal VBA script were the code came back faster and reduced down to one button. The cons were trying to change the script to a more general form to work for many data sets which came with alot of debugging and editing errors.
